## About The Project

[![Proximity Radar screenshot][sample-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Proximity Radar is one of my proudest achievements in Forza Motorsport. You can see that version [here](https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1812895088571195739). It was a system I advocated for as a competitive fan of Forza. I saw it through from concept to completion. I was responsible for making the prototype, creating technical documentation, leading a feature team, testing, and the actual C++ implementation. 

As it's one of my favorite features, I decided to re-create it in Unreal Engine 5. I wanted to have it as a small portfolio piece.
